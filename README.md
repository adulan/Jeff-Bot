# JeffBot

A Discord bot to help run Discord Survivor ORGs

This was written mainly for my own ORGs, but it can also be used by anyone in their own ORGs. You'll have to create your own Discord bot to do this, though, as I didn't write this to handle more than one season at a time.

## Installing

To install, copy all files to a single directory.

The token must be kept in separate files. For JeffBot, place the token in a file named `token`. The file must be in the same directory as the rest of the program.

> NOTE: Both bots must be run from the directory they are in.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6.2+
* Rapptz's `discord.py` library

`pip` should handle the library for you. I recommend checking the [discord.py repository](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) out yourself.
